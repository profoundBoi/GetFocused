        <p>It's simple, I only work with the best and for me when it comes to photography I only work with Craig Owen. Craig is a true
          professional and he is pedantic which results in work that is of the highest standard and is a well polished product. In addition 
          to this, Craig really understands how I work and easily fits in with the rest of the team which helps me to deliver a great end
          result to my clients. Thanks Craig!

          Craig is always professional, flexible and creative. His photographic style is funky and fresh, he always managers to make guest
          laugh and gets the bets photos out of events! Always my first choice.
